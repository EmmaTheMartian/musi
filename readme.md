musi is an artistic programming language for embedding into projects and
creating cohesive domain specific languages.

musi is pretty heavily inspired by lua, although still feels quite different
from it.

## artistic?

yes! musi is intended to be used to make domain specific languages, which means
that its syntax should be comfortable* to read.

musi can be modified using the v api, although i am planning to make c bindings
so that musi can be added to basically any project, for any purpose!
