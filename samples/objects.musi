# objects do not technically exist in musi, but you can use tables and some functions, like so:

# make a "namespace" to hold the functions related to Person
let Person = {
	# there's a macro for making simple constructors, which we can use here.
	new = macros.@constructor(name, age)

	greet = fn self do
		fprintln('Hello, %!', [self.name])
	end
}
println(Person)

let gandalf = Person.new("Gandalf", 50000)
Person.greet(gandalf)
